# Tuna Desktop keymap

The single reference for every keyboard chord in the session:
shell chords drive the panel, dock, popups, and overview; the
compositor owns window chords. The two sets never overlap — shell
chords stay off Super+{tap,PgUp,PgDn,arrows,R,T} and Alt+{Tab,F4},
pinned by collision tests on both crates.

## Shell: focus movement

The shell keeps one keyboard cursor on a region: the panel strip
(clock, three tiles, hosted indicator cells), the dock slots, an
open popup's rows, or the overview's result list. The focused stop
paints an accent ring.

| Chord | Effect |
|---|---|
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Next / previous stop or row, wrapping |
| Left / Right | Previous / next stop or row |
| Up / Down | Panel to dock and back; rows inside a popup or the overview |
| F6 | Cycle panel and dock regions (skips an empty dock) |
| Super+D | Focus the dock |
| Alt+F1 | Focus the panel |

While the overview is open, movement keys walk the result list;
the region keys still jump the shell underneath.

## Shell: activation and Escape

| Chord | Effect |
|---|---|
| Enter, overview open | Activate the focused result row (top hit from any other region) |
| Enter, overview closed | Activate the focused stop: strip stops toggle their popups, dock slots take a left press (launch, switch, stack), popup rows fire |
| Typing, overview open | Search query (restarts the result cursor) |
| Backspace, overview open | Erase a query character |
| Escape, popup open | Close the popup, restore the parked shell focus |
| Escape, overview open, no popup | Dismiss the overview onto the previously focused window |
| Escape, all closed | No-op |

Opening a popup or the overview parks the live cursor on a return
stack; closing settles back through it, so focus never sticks on a
closed surface. No chord here is rebindable yet; there is no AT-SPI
bridge yet.

## Compositor: windows and session

| Chord | Effect |
|---|---|
| Super tap | Toggle the overview |
| Super+PgUp / Super+PgDn | Switch workspace (plus Shift: move the focused window and follow) |
| Alt+Tab / Shift+Alt+Tab | Step the window switcher; Alt release commits, Escape cancels |
| Super+Up / Super+Down | Maximize / restore the focused window |
| Super+Left / Super+Right | Tile the focused window left / right half |
| Alt+F4 | Ask the focused window to close |
| Super+Shift+T | Flip floating / strip session mode |
| Super+R / Super+Shift+R | Step the focused column through width presets (strip mode) |
| Super+Left / Super+Right | Strip mode: focus the column left / right (plus Shift: move the column) |
| Super+Up / Super+Down | Strip mode, in a shared column: focus the window above / below (plus Shift: move it); a lone window keeps the gnome meaning above |
| Super+[ / Super+] | Strip mode: a lone window joins the bottom of the column on that side; a window sharing a column leaves it for a new column on that side (niri `consume-or-expel-window-left/right`) |
| Super+, / Super+. | Strip mode: take the next column's top window into the focused column / send its bottom window out to a new column on the right (niri `consume-window-into-column` / `expel-window-from-column`) |
| Super+left-drag | Move a window; in strip mode drop it at the nearest column gap, or into a column at the nearest window edge. The modifier follows `mouse-button-modifier` |
| Super+middle-drag | Resize from the edges of the window third under the pointer; its middle third is a plain click. Strip mode: the column width, or the window's height inside a shared column. Right instead of middle with `resize-with-right-button` |
| Super+right-click | GNOME's window menu, in both modes. Middle instead of right with `resize-with-right-button` |

## GTK shell: top bar, menus, overview

The GTK shell follows GNOME 51's chords, every one rebindable
through its settings key (`org.gnome.shell.keybindings`,
`org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings`, `org.gnome.mutter.keybindings`,
`org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys`):

| Chord | Effect |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+Alt+Tab / Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Tab | Focus the top bar: first / last control (`switch-panels`) |
| Tab / Shift+Tab, bar focused | Walk every panel control: Activities, clock, tray icons, accessibility, system |
| Left / Right, bar focused, no menu | Walk the bar's controls (an open menu owns the arrows) |
| Down, panel menu button focused | Open its menu with the first item focused (popupMenu.js `_onKeyPress`) |
| Left / Right, panel menu open | Move inside the menu; at its edge, close it and open the neighbouring panel menu (panelMenu.js `_onMenuKeyPress`, PopupMenuManager `_changeMenu`) |
| Enter / Space, bar focused | Activate the focused control; on Activities, toggle the overview |
| Escape, panel menu open | Close the menu; focus stays on its button |
| Escape, bar focused, no menu | Return focus to the client |
| Super+S / Super+V | Quick settings / date menu; Tab, arrows and Enter operate them, Escape closes |
| Shift+F10 / Menu, quick settings | On a toggle with a menu (or its arrow), the volume slider, or Power Off: open that menu (St `popup-menu`) |
| Delete / BackSpace, notification focused | Close it: a banner as dismissed, a list message or collapsed group from the list (messageList.js) |
| Enter / Escape, date menu message list | Enter on a collapsed group expands it (focus moves into it); Escape collapses it back onto the group before the menu closes (calendar.js) |
| Super+A | App grid: Tab or Down from the search entry focuses the first tile, arrows and Tab walk the tiles across pages, PgUp/PgDn turn pages, Enter launches, Escape leaves |
| Tab / Down, overview entry, no search | Into the window previews (the app grid on Super+A), named by window title; arrows and Tab move between them, Enter activates the window, Up from the top row or Shift+Tab from the first returns to the entry, typing returns to it with the text (overviewControls.js focus chain) |
| Super+1..9 / Super+Ctrl+1..9 | Dash app: switch-or-launch / open a new window |
| Super+N | Focus the notification banner itself (Enter activates it, Tab reaches its buttons); Escape releases the keyboard and expires the banner (messageTray.js) |
| Super+Alt+S | Screen reader on/off (gsd's `screenreader` key) |
| Print / Shift+Print / Alt+Print | Screenshot UI / fullscreen shot / window shot (S/C/W pick, Enter, Space or Ctrl+C captures, Escape closes) |

While the bar holds keyboard focus, NORMAL/OVERVIEW chords pause
(the compositor's exclusive-popup mode); volume, brightness and
input-source keys keep working. Opening the overview hands the
keyboard over; closing it releases a hold the bar never won.

## P-A11Y-02 audit: every pointer action's keyboard route

Enumerated from `crates/shell-gtk/src` (every `connect_clicked`,
`GestureClick`, drag/drop and long-press handler) against gnome-shell
51.0 (`js/ui`, `src/st`). "GNOME route" cites where GNOME 51 binds the
key; where GNOME has no keyboard route the row is parity, not a gap.
Proof gates are in `scripts/tuna-gtk-shell-proof` (the P-A11Y-02 ones
in `scripts/lib/tuna-keyboard-routes-proof.sh`, also run alone with
`--keyboard-routes-only`); each drives real X11 keys through the
nested session and reads the AT-SPI tree or the bus back. Banner-focus
gates wait up to five seconds for the exact banner's showing/focused
state after one chord; they do not repeat the key or accept another
focused control.
