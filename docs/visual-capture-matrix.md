# Visual capture coverage matrix

Per-feature visual capture of Tuna Desktop v1 from the frozen Wave 3
integration head. Every one of the 72 parity-ledger rows
(`docs/parity-ledger.md`) and all 46 walkthrough entries
(`docs/walkthrough.tsv`) maps below to the capture stage(s) that collect
it, or to an explicit reason nested fixtures cannot show it. Checked by
`scripts/tuna-visual-capture --check-matrix` in CI.

## Frozen source

- Branch head: `b1c929aa55b0f3286458035fbc81ecd62d168496` (#633 integration head).
- PR #633 tested merge commit: `7b6c85922af14f4c239a4f958262b657adc6b03f`.
  The two identities are distinct: per-run `provenance.json` pins the
  exact built tree from the checkout (`built_head_sha`,
  `built_tree_sha`) and records the event SHA separately as
  informational (never as the tested tree), and CI attempts are never
  merged into one capture session (audit provenance finding).
- Capture tooling: `scripts/tuna-visual-capture` (stages) plus
  `scripts/lib/tuna-visual-label.py` (honest frame labels) and
  `scripts/lib/tuna-visual-finalize.py` (label-coupled verdicts);
  dispatchable workflow `.github/workflows/visual-capture.yml`.

## Reading this matrix

Status vocabulary (no whole-feature visual qualification is claimed
anywhere in this document; the audit's 16 "observed subset" rows stay
open until the gaps below close):

- `nested` — stills of this state come from the named nested stage.
- `clip` — a real x11grab transition clip (or timestamped still pair
  where recording is unavailable) comes from the named stage.
- `partial` — nested capture shows a subset only; the gap column says
  what is still unproven.
- `nonvisual` — behavior with no pixels of its own; evidence is consumer
  output or CI logs, not frames.
- `unsupported-in-nested` — the state needs hardware, the installed
  image, or real services; see `docs/visual-capture-corral-request.md`.
- `missing-product` — the behavior is unimplemented at this head, so
  there is nothing truthful to capture yet.
- `unproven` — drivable in nested fixtures but no adequate capture
  reviewed yet (neither audit nor new stages cover it).

Audit column: the 2026-10-12 visual audit's verdict per row
(`Observed subset`, `No adequate capture`, `FAIL`, or
`Transition clip required`). Tour frames whose title cards still say Roost
on TunaOS Marlin are labeled as observed and never presented as Tuna
feature proof.

A capture failure is reported as a capture failure. A still labeled
`indistinguishable-from-baseline` (or a missing still) does not assert
the product is broken: the audit's still-vs-video finding (a wrong tour
still beside a 28 s clip that does show quick settings) is why every
state records its state observation next to its stills and clips.

## Walkthrough freshness

The checked-in `docs/walkthrough/` images predate this pipeline and are
STALE until a refresh lands; `scripts/tuna-walkthrough freshness`
reports all 46 as such (exit 1) when no per-frame manifest exists, and
the `visual-capture` workflow's manifest job prints that report on
every run as a visible, non-gating step. CURRENT requires the bytes to
match the recorded capture hash AND the recorded built tree to equal
the expected identity for the reviewed head (explicit `--expect-*`
flags, defaulting to the checkout); self-consistent but
different-source manifests read STALE, except for adopt drift (trees
differing only in the walkthrough's own paths). `scripts/tuna-walkthrough
refresh` rebuilds images ONLY from exact successful artifacts (pinned
run id, one attempt, all consumed stages ok, one built tree,
hash-validated inputs, proven frames with preserved labels, baseline
only for the desktop state), writing `walkthrough/manifest.json` with
each frame's hash, capture outcome and source IDs (built head/tree,
event SHA, branch, package/image IDs, run id, attempt). Map:
`docs/walkthrough-visual.tsv`. Procedure and exact commands:
`docs/visual-capture-refresh.md`. No refresh has been performed from
any run yet. Behavioral coverage for the new subcommands lives in
`scripts/lib/tuna-walkthrough-freshness-tests.py` (run by the
visual-capture build job, not by any existing gate). The existing
`tuna-walkthrough check` (markdown + existence) is unchanged.

## Per-state validators and verdict coupling

Generic screening ("differs from the desktop", "stage exited ok") is
not named-state proof: every capture state declares a
consumer+render validator (`require_jq`, `require_cstate`,
`require_frame_differs`, `require_nonempty_file`, `require_absent`)
that fails the state when the expected content did not render, and
`scripts/lib/tuna-visual-validators-tests.py` fails if any driven
state lacks one. As a second layer,
`scripts/lib/tuna-visual-finalize.py` demotes any non-exempt state
whose stills hold no `feature` frame (wallpaper-only, duplicates, or
unverified) to failed, however its drive commands exited. Exemptions:
`panel/desktop` (the desktop is the baseline),
`settings-a11y/clock` (sub-threshold seconds digits; settings-key
validated), and `transitions/*` (clip-led; gated by clips plus
compositor end-states). Partial stages stay collectable (collector
green) but are exposed per-state in `stage.json`, the merged
`manifest.json` summary counts, and the CI merge report -- and
`refresh` refuses them by name. Labeling and finalize behavior are
covered by `scripts/lib/tuna-visual-label-tests.py` and
`scripts/lib/tuna-visual-finalize-tests.py`; provenance pinning by
`scripts/lib/tuna-visual-provenance-tests.py`.

## Provenance identity

Per-stage `provenance.json` pins the exact built tree from the
checkout itself (`built_head_sha`, `built_tree_sha`,
`tree_diff_sha256`); the triggering event's commit (`event_sha`,
e.g. the PR merge ref) is recorded separately as informational and
is never presented as the tested tree. Refresh validates a passed
`--merge-sha` against every consumed provenance and fails closed on
mismatch.

## Known-blocker coverage

- The tour's `T-app-grid`, `T-calendar`, `T-quick-settings` (wallpaper
  only) and `T-overview` (dash without overview card) are replaced by
  state-confirmed nested captures: every still ships with its a11y or
  compositor-state observation, and the labeler marks any wallpaper-only
  frame `indistinguishable-from-baseline` instead of presenting it as
  proof.
- The GTK proof's `G-GRID-DRAG-CANCEL` saved-layout failure aborts the
  monolithic proof and leaves later walkthrough states absent. The
  stage:search-apps `drag-cancel` state captures the same drag (peek
  frame, settled post-cancel frame, before/after `app-picker-layout`)
  inside try/continue isolation: its outcome can never block the other
  seven search-apps states, the other thirteen stages, or the merged
  manifest.
