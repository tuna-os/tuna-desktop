# GNOME settings compatibility map

Tuna Desktop reads GNOME 51's own GSettings schemas. It ships no shim schemas
and runs no translating daemon.

The [exhaustive desktop inventory](settings-desktop-inventory.md) lists
every one of the 428 GNOME 51 desktop-schema keys. The sections below
explain common keys and related Shell/Mutter/settings-daemon settings. The Marlin image already carries
`gsettings-desktop-schemas`, so the keys exist and GNOME Settings can write them. Schema presence does not
establish functional compatibility: [the GNOME Settings audit](gnome-settings-audit.md)
tracks ineffective controls and unqualified service integrations. Ledger row P-ST-01 tracks this page.

This page records that decision for R9 (knowledge entry
`learnings/dconf-settings-interop.md`).

**Status words.**
- **Honored**: Tuna Desktop reads the key and reacts while it runs.
- **Via GTK**: GTK or libadwaita reads the key for every app and for the
  shell, so nothing in Tuna Desktop has to.
- **Ignored**: the key has no effect yet. The reason and owner are given.

## org.gnome.desktop.interface

| Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| color-scheme | Honored | The Dark Style tile writes it. The shell and apps follow it through libadwaita. Proof G-QS-DARK |
| accent-color | Via GTK | libadwaita applies it |
| font-name | Honored | Live shell CSS family, base size, weight, style and stretch (with semantic emphasis preserved) and GTK client font settings; proof G-SETTINGS-FONT |
| document-font-name, monospace-font-name | Via GTK | Live for GTK apps reading the keys via Gio.Settings (as gnome-terminal/gedit do), with a visible repaint; Tuna Desktop chrome still uses font-name. Proof G-SET-FONTS |
| text-scaling-factor | Via GTK | Live GTK Wayland DPI translation; proof G-SETTINGS-FONT |
| gtk-theme, icon-theme, cursor-theme, cursor-size | Via GTK | Inside apps. The compositor's own cursor ignores them (#89) |
| clock-format | Honored | Panel clock, live 12h/24h rendering. Proof G-SET-CLOCK |
| clock-show-weekday, clock-show-date, clock-show-seconds | Honored | Panel clock, built as gnome-desktop's wall clock builds it. Proofs G-SETTINGS-CLOCK (seconds), G-SET-CLOCK (date) |
| enable-hot-corners | Honored | Live. Proof G-SETTINGS-INPUT |
| enable-animations | Honored | Live idle fade, GTK transitions and compositor overview/strip motion; disabled transitions finish immediately. Proofs G-ANIMATIONS-OFF, G-INTROSPECT-MOTION |
| show-battery-percentage | Honored | UPower DisplayDevice panel percentage; updates live |

GNOME 51 `org.gnome.desktop.a11y.interface reduced-motion` is read live and combines with `enable-animations` into one motion policy shared by the shell and compositor: `full`, `fade-only` or `off`. `enable-animations=false` is `off`: every transition finishes immediately. `reduce` with animations enabled is `fade-only`, as in GNOME 51: opacity fades (the idle shield) keep running, while translation and scale (compositor overview and strip motion, the shell's GTK transitions) finish immediately. `enable-animations` itself, and Introspect's `AnimationsEnabled`, stay true under Reduced Motion, as GNOME reports them. GNOME Shell's `GNOME_SHELL_SLOWDOWN_FACTOR` environment variable scales every duration as GNOME's `adjustAnimationTime` does. Older schema sets keep the existing animation policy. This controls the desktop shell; application toolkits remain responsible for their own transitions. Proofs G-ANIMATIONS-OFF, G-INTROSPECT-MOTION.

## Session, lock and notifications

| Schema and key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay | Honored | Live, through the shell's `SetIdleTimeout` command (G-SETTINGS-IDLE); gsd-power dims at half the delay and blanks 30 s into idleness once the shield is up (V-GSD-POWER-IDLE) |
| org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled, lock-delay | Honored | Idle fades to black over ten seconds; lock waits for the larger of fade duration and lock-delay. Activity cancels blanking; an authenticated lock remains latched |
| org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri | Honored | Blurred, dimmed lock background; empty or missing files fall back to the desktop wallpaper |
| org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners | Honored | Mirrors Do Not Disturb live in both directions. Proof G-NOTIFY-DND and G-SETTINGS-NOTIFICATIONS (external writes and banner policy) |
| org.gnome.desktop.search-providers (all keys) | Honored | disable-external, disabled, enabled and sort-order. Proof G-SEARCH-PROVIDER |
| org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri, picture-uri-dark | Honored | Wallpaper: live publish, file identity, decode and visible repaint, with file-replacement refresh, an ignored invalid URI and revert. Proof G-SET-WALLPAPER |
| org.gnome.shell favorite-apps | Honored | Used for the dash when Tuna Desktop has no pins of its own |
| org.gnome.desktop.app-folders (folder-children and each folder's name, apps, categories, excluded-apps, translate) | Honored | App-grid folders, read on each grid open. Proof G-APP-FOLDERS |
| org.gnome.shell command-history | Honored | the Run a Command dialog's Up/Down history, GNOME's `HistoryManager` (512 entries, moved-to-end, live reload); written on every new line (`crates/shell-gtk/src/run_dialog.rs`, #357) |
| org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions | Ignored | GNOME Shell extensions are JavaScript. Tuna Desktop has its own extension point |
| org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount, autorun-never, autorun-x-content-start-app, autorun-x-content-ignore, autorun-x-content-open-folder | Honored | GNOME Shell 51's automount and autorun components in the GTK shell (`crates/shell-gtk/src/removable_media.rs`): hotplugged volumes mount while unlocked, active and uninhibited (automount inhibitor flag 16 from the compositor's `org.gnome.SessionManager`); a new mount launches its first `x-content` type's default app, opens the folder, does nothing, or posts the "“name” connected" notification with "Open with" actions. Mounts without an `x-content` type are sniffed in-process (gnome-shell's hotplug sniffer). `automount-open` has no GNOME 51 consumer (#361) |
| org.gnome.shell remember-mount-password | Honored | The shell's volume passphrase prompt (`crates/shell-gtk/src/mount_operation.rs`, GNOME's `ShellMountPasswordDialog`) starts "Remember Password" from it and writes the choice back on Unlock (#361) |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.color night-light-enabled | Honored | The Night Light tile writes it; the compositor reads it live and tints every output in GL. It owns `org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Color`, so gsd-color is not started. Proof G-QS-NIGHT (#339) |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.color night-light-temperature, night-light-schedule-automatic, night-light-schedule-from, night-light-schedule-to, night-light-last-coordinates | Honored | Read live by the compositor: gsd 51's clamp, local-time automatic and from/to schedules (midnight wrap, DST, runtime zone change), one-hour edge smear and 5 s jump smoothing. Geoclue never updates night-light-last-coordinates, so automatic mode uses the stored value or the from/to window. Proof G-QS-NIGHT drives NightLightPreview against night-light-temperature (#339) |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim, idle-brightness | Honored | gsd-power calls the shell's `org.gnome.Shell.Brightness.SetDimming`; the shell clips to `idle-brightness`. Proof V-GSD-POWER-IDLE (call observed; no physical backlight in the VM) |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-timeout, sleep-inactive-ac-type, sleep-inactive-battery-timeout, sleep-inactive-battery-type, power-saver-profile-on-low-battery, ambient-enabled | Honored (unqualified) | Consumed by the running gsd-power; automatic suspend, battery policy and ambient light are not proven (gsd-power never suspends a VM) |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power power-button-action | Honored | gsd-media-keys holds logind's `handle-power-key`, `handle-suspend-key` and `handle-hibernate-key` block inhibitor, so logind's HandlePowerKey never applies. The power key follows the key live, as in GNOME 51: `interactive` calls `org.gnome.SessionManager.Shutdown`, which opens the shell's end-session dialog (nothing while locked); `suspend` and `hibernate` go through logind and fall back to the dialog when logind cannot do them; `nothing` does nothing. gsd 51 powers a virtual machine (hostnamed chassis `vm`) off for every value except `nothing`. Proof V-POWER-BUTTON |

## GNOME Settings Daemon plugins

GNOME 51 starts gnome-settings-daemon's plugins from gnome-session's
`gnome-session-basic-services.target` and `gnome-session-services.target`
(gnome-session 51 `data/`), each through the plugin's own
`org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.<Plugin>.target`, which requires
`gnome-session-initialized.target`. `tuna-session.target` wants
`gnome-session.target`, `gnome-session-initialized.target` and the plugin
targets below; the compositor holds gnome-session's leader FIFO so the targets
and plugins stop with the session, and starts
`gnome-session-x11-services-ready.target` when Xwayland is up, as GNOME Shell
51 does. The compositor serves the `org.gnome.SessionManager` subset the
plugins and the shell's power menu use (`InhibitedActions`, `SessionIsActive`,
`Inhibit`, `Uninhibit`, `IsInhibited`, `GetInhibitors`, `Suspend`, and
`Shutdown`, `Reboot` and `Logout`, which open the shell's
`org.gnome.SessionManager.EndSessionDialog` and carry its confirmation out);
idle inhibitors also hold off Tuna's idle lock.
Its `RestoreSupported` is false, as gnome-session 51 reports it, so GNOME
Settings hides "Reopen Windows After Login"; window restoration is the client
opt-in of `xdg_session_manager_v1` (P-SY-08).
Proof V-GSD-PLUGINS checks every started plugin's process, user, unit and bus name.

| Plugin (bus name `org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.*`) | GNOME 51 target | Tuna session |
|---|---|---|
| Power | basic-services | Started by gsd |
| Keyboard | basic-services | Started by gsd |
| Rfkill | basic-services | Started by gsd |
| Sharing | basic-services | Started by gsd |
| Smartcard | basic-services | Started by gsd |
| UsbProtection | basic-services | Started by gsd (acts only with USBGuard) |
| Datetime | services | Started by gsd |
| Housekeeping | services | Started by gsd |
| PrintNotifications | services | Started by gsd |
| ScreensaverProxy | services | Started by gsd (forwards `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver` inhibits to the compositor's session manager) |
| Sound | services | Started by gsd |
| Wwan | services | Started by gsd |
| XSettings | x11-services | Started by gsd when Xwayland is ready (`DISPLAY` published then); `org.gnome.Mutter.X11` is not served, so X11 scale falls back to 1 |
| Color | services | Reimplemented by Tuna: the compositor owns the bus name (Night Light); ICC profiles are missing (P-DS-03) |
| MediaKeys | basic-services | Started by gsd. The shell binds none of the media-keys schema's keys while gsd-media-keys owns its bus name, and serves what it calls: `org.gnome.Shell` `GrabAccelerators`, `UngrabAccelerators`, `ShowOSD`, `FocusSearch`, `AcceleratorActivated`; `org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock`; `org.gnome.Shell.AudioDeviceSelection`; and the end-session dialog through the compositor's `org.gnome.SessionManager`. The screen brightness keys are GNOME Shell's own in GNOME 51 and stay the shell's |
| A11ySettings | basic-services | Reimplemented by Tuna: the compositor runs Orca and the shell sets `toolkit-accessibility`; gsd would start a second Orca |

## Displays

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ~/.config/monitors.xml | Honored | The arrangement for the lit connectors sets each output's scale, position and primary monitor (hardware sessions). Proof D-SCALE |
| GNOME Settings' Displays panel | Partial | org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig as Mutter 51: every mode, refresh rate and scale listed; resolution, refresh, scale, position, rotation, primary, mirroring and switching monitors off apply live; persistent changes await GNOME Shell's "Keep these display settings?" dialog (20 s revert) and are kept in Mutter's monitors.xml format in ~/.config/tuna/monitors.xml, read before GNOME's file. Proof G-DISPLAY-SETTINGS, D-MODES |

## Window management and input

| Schema and key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| org.gnome.shell.keybindings show-screenshot-ui, toggle-overview, toggle-application-view, toggle-message-tray, toggle-quick-settings, switch-to-application-1..9, open-new-window-application-1..9, screenshot, screenshot-window, screen-brightness-up, screen-brightness-down | Honored | read live, GNOME 51's defaults when the schema is missing; grabbed through the compositor like any accelerator (`crates/shell-gtk/src/keybindings.rs`) |
| org.gnome.shell.keybindings show-screen-recording-ui, focus-active-notification, shift-overview-up/down | Honored | recording UI; focus the current banner (Escape returns input); step session/picker/app grid in both directions; read and rebound live through shell grabs |
| org.gnome.shell.keybindings screen-brightness-up/down-monitor, screen-brightness-cycle(-monitor) | Honored | up/down/cycle through logind; monitor keys select the DRM connector under the pointer and never substitute another screen's backlight. Devices without a kernel connector association are unsupported and unchanged |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys screensaver | Honored | gsd-media-keys grabs it and calls `org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock`, which the shell refuses under `disable-lock-screen`. Without gsd-media-keys (the nested preview starts no session services) the shell binds it itself, with Super+L as the default. Proofs V-LOCK, G-LOCK-KEY |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-up/down/mute, quiet/precise variants, mic-mute, their -static bindings, volume-step | Honored | gsd-media-keys in the session: PipeWire through its Pulse server, `volume-step` (2% precise), the `allow-volume-above-100-percent` ceiling, feedback sounds, and the OSD through `ShowOSD`, including while locked. Without gsd-media-keys the shell's native PipeWire subset handles the same keys and stands down as soon as gsd-media-keys appears. Proofs V-MEDIA-VOLUME, V-AUDIO-AMPLIFICATION, G-GSD-MIC-MUTE, G-GSD-VOLUME-ONCE; native: G-MEDIA-VOLUME |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys (every other key: play, pause, stop, previous, next, playback-*, the launchers, custom-keybindings, touchpad-toggle/on/off, rotate-video-lock, the accessibility toggles, eject, battery-status, rfkill, keyboard-brightness-*, logout, reboot, shutdown, power, suspend, hibernate) | Honored | gsd-media-keys: playback keys drive MPRIS players, launchers and custom shortcuts start through GIO, `rotate-video-lock` writes `orientation-lock` (which the compositor follows), the session keys call `org.gnome.SessionManager`. `touchpad-toggle` writes `send-events`, which takes effect with Tuna's touchpad device policy (#814). Proofs G-GSD-MPRIS, G-GSD-LAUNCHER, V-POWER-BUTTON |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings activate-window-menu, toggle-maximized, maximize, unmaximize, minimize, close, begin-move, begin-resize, switch-input-source(-backward), switch-to-workspace-1/last/left/right, move-to-workspace-1/last/left/right; org.gnome.mutter.keybindings toggle-tiled-left/right | Honored | read live (GNOME 51's defaults without the schema), grabbed like any accelerator; once the shell grabs them the compositor's built-in defaults stand aside, so a rebound key moves and an emptied one reaches apps |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications(-backward), switch-group(-backward) | Honored | read live (GNOME 51's defaults without the schema) and handed to the compositor, which holds the switcher open while the chord's modifiers are held and commits when they are released; Shift steps backward, `Above_Tab` is the key above Tab |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows(-backward), cycle-windows(-backward), cycle-group(-backward) | Honored | compositor drives bound keys through SetSwitcherKeys: a window-only MRU popup (current workspace), or immediate window/app-group cycling without a popup. GNOME's switch-windows defaults are empty |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout | Via GTK | Client-side decorations read it |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences focus-mode, auto-raise, auto-raise-delay, raise-on-click, mouse-button-modifier, resize-with-right-button; org.gnome.mutter focus-change-on-pointer-rest | Honored | Read live by the compositor on an owned GIO thread, as Mutter 51 reads them in-process; GNOME 51's defaults (pointer rest on, as GNOME Shell's override) when a schema is missing. Sloppy/mouse focus on enter without raising, auto-raise in those modes only, raise-on-click for clicks, client activations and short grabs, the modifier and button for move/resize/window menu. Tuna differs: the scrollable strip keeps click focus; Mod2/Mod3/Mod5 modifiers contribute nothing. Proofs G-FOCUS-SLOPPY, G-FOCUS-AUTORAISE, G-FOCUS-MOUSE, G-FOCUS-RAISE-ON-CLICK, G-FOCUS-MODIFIER |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences num-workspaces | Honored | Read live by the shell (1–36) and applied by the compositor while `dynamic-workspaces` is off: empty slots kept, shrinking moves windows on removed workspaces to the new last one, as mutter 51. Proof G-WS-FIXED |
| org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences audible-bell, visual-bell, visual-bell-type | Honored | The shell publishes the bell policy and the compositor rings, flashes the frame or flashes the screen as mutter 51 `src/core/bell.c`. Consumer tests only; audible/visual qualification stays open under #353 |
| org.gnome.mutter dynamic-workspaces, workspaces-only-on-primary, edge-tiling, center-new-windows | Honored | Read live by the shell into InputSettings (GNOME session defaults when the schema is missing). Dynamic workspaces follow gnome-shell 51's WorkspaceTracker, switching live to and from a fixed count; windows on a non-primary output show on every workspace and land on the active workspace when they return to the primary or the key goes off (mutter `meta_window_on_all_workspaces_changed`); edge tiling gates pointer-drag tiling and its preview; center-new-windows chooses mutter's centred placement or `find_first_fit` from the work area's corner. Proofs G-WS-FIXED, G-EDGE-TILING-OFF, G-CENTER-NEW-WINDOWS; multiple outputs by cargo test only (the nested proof has one output) |
| org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only, org.gnome.shell.window-switcher current-workspace-only | Honored | Read live by the shell, including while a switcher is open; independent keys with GNOME 51's defaults (apps off, windows on). Proof G-SWITCHER-WORKSPACE |
| org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat, delay, repeat-interval | Honored | Seat key repeat, live. Proof G-SETTINGS-INPUT |
| org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard (Sticky, Slow, Bounce, Toggle and Mouse Keys, their beeps and delays, `enable`) | Honored | Live; applied in the compositor's input pipeline before keybindings, the lock screen and every client, XWayland included. The keyboard shortcuts' switches are saved by the shell, which shows GNOME's confirmation. `timeout-enable` and `disable-timeout` are ignored, as in Mutter. Proofs G-A11Y-STICKY, G-A11Y-SHORTCUTS, G-A11Y-SLOW, G-A11Y-BOUNCE, G-A11Y-MOUSEKEYS |
| org.gnome.desktop.a11y.mouse (secondary click, hover click: time, threshold, mode, gesture directions) | Honored | Live; applied in the compositor's input pipeline ahead of every client. Window mode shows GNOME's click-type chooser in the panel; the shell draws GNOME's pie timer during each timeout. `click-type-window-visible` is ignored, as in GNOME Shell 51. Proofs G-A11Y-DWELL, G-A11Y-SECONDARY |
| org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click, natural-scroll, speed, disable-while-typing, left-handed, send-events, click-method, edge-scrolling-enabled, two-finger-scrolling-enabled, tap-and-drag, tap-and-drag-lock, tap-button-map, middle-click-emulation, accel-profile | Honored | libinput on hardware sessions, live and on hotplug, with Mutter 51's touchpad rules; left/right/mouse enum resolved in the shell. `disabled-on-external-mouse` is libinput's own mode; edge scrolling yields to two-finger scrolling as in Mutter; `tap-and-drag-lock` gets libinput's timeout drag lock (the pinned bindings cannot ask for Mutter's sticky lock); `custom` acceleration and `disable-while-typing-timeout` are unsupported by the pinned bindings and keep the device default. Proofs V-MOUSE-HANDEDNESS, V-POINTER-LIVE, V-POINTER-HOTPLUG, G-SETTINGS-POINTER; the VM has no touchpad, so touchpad application is unit-tested and physical qualification remains (#343) |
| org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse natural-scroll, speed, left-handed, accel-profile, middle-click-emulation, scroll-wheel-emulation-button, scroll-wheel-emulation-button-lock | Honored | libinput on hardware sessions, live and on hotplug. `accel-profile`, middle-click and scroll-wheel emulation apply to mice only (not trackballs or pointing sticks, as Mutter 51); `custom` acceleration falls back to the device default. Proofs V-MOUSE-HANDEDNESS, V-POINTER-LIVE, V-POINTER-HOTPLUG, G-SETTINGS-POINTER (#343) |
| org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.trackball accel-profile, middle-click-emulation, scroll-wheel-emulation-button, scroll-wheel-emulation-button-lock; org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.pointingstick speed, accel-profile, scroll-method | Honored | libinput on hardware sessions, live and on hotplug, for devices udev tags `ID_INPUT_TRACKBALL` / `ID_INPUT_POINTINGSTICK` (device or parent), as Mutter 51; trackballs keep the mouse speed, pointing sticks take their own. `custom` acceleration falls back to the device default. Proof G-SETTINGS-POINTER; the VM has neither device, so application is unit-tested and physical qualification remains (#343) |
| org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchscreen orientation-lock | Ignored | No GSettings reader yet: the compositor's `OrientationPolicy` honors `InputSettings.orientation_lock` and serves `PanelOrientationManaged` live, but nothing publishes the key (mutter 51 `CONF_SCHEMA`; #345 follow-up) |
| org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources, xkb-options | Honored | xkb sources become one keymap in order; Super+Space switches; IBus sources use the supervised bridge (#60). Proof G-SETTINGS-INPUT |
| org.gnome.desktop.input-sources mru-sources, per-window | Honored | GNOME 51's InputSourceManager in the GTK shell: MRU order seeded from and saved to `mru-sources`, the Super+Space switcher popup over it, per-window sources (the overview counts as a window). XKB sources only (#346). Proofs G-INPUT-SOURCE-MRU, G-INPUT-PER-WINDOW |
| org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard remember-numlock-state, numlock-state | Honored | The compositor restores Num Lock at startup and saves each change, as mutter 51 does; keymap reloads keep it (#346). Proof G-NUMLOCK |
| org.gnome.desktop.a11y.* | Partial / missing | Some keys reach GTK and the keyboard and pointer aids are honored (above); zoom, screen keyboard and several modern preferences lack consumers. Spoken screen-reader acceptance remains unqualified; see the control-center audit |

`J-SETTINGS-LIVE` changes `clock-format` with `gsettings set` during the
nested journey and asserts the shell’s consumed settings snapshot before
restoring it. GTK font/scale, dark style, input, idle and rebound keybinding
changes have separate live graphical gates, as do wallpaper
identity/refresh (`G-SET-WALLPAPER`), clock format/date rendering
(`G-SET-CLOCK`) and document/monospace app reads (`G-SET-FONTS`); each
reverts its keys and carries a negative control.
