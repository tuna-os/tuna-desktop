# Self-hosted CI runners (karnataka)

Most `ci` lanes run on self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on `karnataka`, the
k3s node that also hosts KubeVirt, corral-web and the `punjab` VM. GitHub's
own runners are still used for fork pull requests, for the lanes listed under
[What runs where](#what-runs-where), and for everything when the
[rollback switch](#roll-back-to-github-hosted-runners) is on.

Everything below assumes `kubectl --context karnataka-k3s`, `helm` (v3.8+ or
v4), `gh` logged in as an org admin, and `ssh karnataka` with sudo.

## Components

| Piece | Where | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ARC controller | namespace `arc-systems`, Helm release `arc` | `gha-runner-scale-set-controller` chart; watches only `tuna-ci` |
| Scale set `tuna-ci-24.04` | namespace `tuna-ci`, release `tuna-ci-24-04` | [values](../.github/runners/values-24.04.yaml); jobs that use `ubuntu-latest` on GitHub |
| Scale set `tuna-ci-26.04` | namespace `tuna-ci`, release `tuna-ci-26-04` | [values](../.github/runners/values-26.04.yaml); jobs that use `ubuntu-26.04` on GitHub |
| Runner image | node-local containerd, `localhost/tuna-ci-runner:<ubuntu>-<runner>-<stamp>` | [Containerfile](../.github/runners/image/Containerfile), built by [build-image](../.github/runners/build-image) |
| Guard rails | [cluster.yaml](../.github/runners/cluster.yaml) | namespace, admission policy, NetworkPolicy, quota, priority class |
| Scratch storage | namespace `tuna-ci-storage`, StorageClass `tuna-ci-scratch` | [storage.yaml](../.github/runners/storage.yaml); dedicated local-path provisioner on `vg1/tuna_ci_scratch` (nvme1n1) |
| Scripts | [.github/runners](../.github/runners) | `build-image` (images), `deploy` (guard rails + scratch provisioner + Helm releases) |
| GitHub side | org `tuna-os` | runner group `tuna-desktop-karnataka` (only repository: `tuna-os/tuna-desktop`), secret `tuna-ci-github` in `tuna-ci` |

Both chart releases use the same chart version (0.15.1 at install).

## What runs where

The `runs-on` of a moved job is a YAML alias (`*runner-24` / `*runner-26`)
of the expressions anchored on `select-lanes` and `orca-speech` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. They pick the self-hosted scale set when the
repository variable `CI_RUNNERS` is not `hosted` **and** the event is a push,
schedule, dispatch or a pull request whose head repository is
`tuna-os/tuna-desktop`; otherwise the original GitHub-hosted label.

| Runner | Lanes |
| --- | --- |
| `tuna-ci-24.04` | select-lanes, check, fprint-phase-proof, app-content, scroll-proof, grid-cancel-comparison, gtk-shell, parity-ledger, docs-shots, ci-gate |
| `tuna-ci-26.04` | journey, orca-speech, portal-security, remote-security, niri-parity |
| GitHub-hosted, always | arch-package, drm-smoke, marlin-vm (both matrix legs), marlin-image |

Why the always-hosted lanes stay hosted:

- **arch-package** is a `container:` job; the runner needs a Docker daemon
  to start the job container, and a daemon needs a privileged pod.
- **drm-smoke** loads `vkms` (and may install its kernel modules) into the
  runner's kernel. On karnataka that is the shared host kernel under punjab
  and KubeVirt, a Fedora kernel the Ubuntu module install cannot target, and
  the module would expose a DRM device to the whole node.
- **marlin-vm** needs more than `/dev/kvm`: it runs
  `podman run --privileged --pid=host -v /dev:/dev … bootc install to-disk
  --via-loopback`, i.e. loop devices and a privileged container, which is
  root on the node. KVM through KubeVirt's device plugin would work, the
  disk build would not.
- **marlin-image** builds the OCI image and, on `main`, pushes it to GHCR
  with a `packages: write` token. Publishing stays on GitHub's ephemeral VMs
  so a compromised long-lived node (or its shared image store) can never
  sign or push a release image.

journey once failed self-hosted in "Qualify disposable Debian lifecycle"
(`end of file on stdin at conffile prompt`); that came from #899 changing
the tuna-lock conffile, which fails hosted runs too, not from the runners
(#930 restores the bytes). The podman lanes (journey, portal-security,
remote-security, niri-parity) use the pods' rootless podman.

Other workflows (`stress`, `fuzz`, `baseline`, …) still use GitHub-hosted
runners; the same aliases can move them.

## Queue supersession and closed pull requests

Every PR-triggered workflow already has native workflow/ref (or PR-number)
`concurrency`: a new push supersedes the older run for that PR without
requiring an Actions write token in PR jobs. Keep those groups separate
between workflows. The `ci` and measured-coverage workflows deliberately do
not cancel an in-progress `main` run: successful main CI supplies the
performance baseline. Native concurrency keeps at most one running and one
pending run per group; it replaces older pending runs, not every main run
finishing in order. Existing schedule, manual and performance concurrency
policies remain unchanged.

Closing a PR does not create a newer run in its concurrency group, so native
supersession cannot retire its queued work. The repository-owned
[`cleanup-closed-pr-runs.yml`](../.github/workflows/cleanup-closed-pr-runs.yml)
runs every 15 minutes (subject to GitHub schedule delays), using
[`scripts/ci-cleanup-closed-pr-runs`](../scripts/ci-cleanup-closed-pr-runs).
It only cancels runs still `queued`, triggered by `pull_request`, with
nonempty, explicit API PR associations **all confirmed closed**. Open PR
heads, running jobs, push, scheduled, manual and performance-baseline
schedule/dispatch runs are not cleanup targets. There is no age threshold,
branch-name inference, force-cancel, local process reaper or semaphore here.
Runs with absent/ambiguous PR associations are intentionally left alone.

The sweep completes a bounded listing (maximum 1,000 filtered runs) and its
candidate PR reads before any cancellation. Failed, incomplete or changing
listings and invalid API responses fail closed. Each candidate run and its
PR states are read again immediately before cancellation; started runs and
reopened PRs are skipped. GitHub has no atomic conditional-cancel endpoint,
so a run can still start or a PR reopen in the interval after that last read.
An API/cancellation failure stops the pass; the next schedule can retry.

Cleanup has one native concurrency owner on GitHub-hosted runners, a
10-minute job limit, and only job-level `contents: read`, `actions: write`
and `pull-requests: read`. It checks out the trusted default-branch event
SHA, never PR code; manual dispatch on another branch is skipped. There is
no `pull_request_target` trigger.

Behavioral smoke checks (the first two are read-only):

```sh
python3 scripts/tests/test_ci_closed_pr_cleanup.py
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) GITHUB_REPOSITORY=tuna-os/tuna-desktop \
  python3 scripts/ci-cleanup-closed-pr-runs
gh workflow run cleanup-closed-pr-runs.yml --ref main
# Explicit opt-in for a manual mutating pass (scheduled passes apply):
gh workflow run cleanup-closed-pr-runs.yml --ref main -f apply=true
```

For an end-to-end queue check, push twice to a disposable open PR and inspect
each workflow's runs: the newer head should supersede the older PR run while
main/scheduled work keeps its existing policy. Close the disposable PR while
one of its runs is queued, then dispatch cleanup and inspect its log and the
run status. A dry run should only print `Would cancel`; an apply pass should
cancel only the closed PR's queued run. The offline suite covers open heads,
running/scheduled/manual work, reopened/shared PRs, missing associations and
API/list failures without contacting GitHub.

## Security model

The repository is public, so the controls assume a job can run arbitrary
code as root inside its pod.

1. **Only this repository's own branches reach the runners.**
   - Workflow: the `runs-on` expression above sends fork pull requests to
     GitHub-hosted runners. `scripts/lib/ci-runner-guard-tests.py` (in
     `check`) dry-runs every alias for own/fork/rollback cases, rejects any
     other self-hosted `runs-on`, and runs the job-started hook below.
   - Runner image: a fork could edit that expression in its own pull
     request, so every job first runs
     [`job-started.sh`](../.github/runners/image/job-started.sh)
     (`ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED`, baked into the image, out of reach
     of workflows). It fails the job before checkout unless the repository
     is `tuna-os/tuna-desktop` and the event is `push`,
     `workflow_dispatch`, `schedule`, or `pull_request` whose head
     repository is `tuna-os/tuna-desktop`.
   - GitHub: the runner group `tuna-desktop-karnataka` has a single selected
     repository, and the repository requires maintainer approval before
     workflows run for **all** outside contributors' pull requests
     (Settings → Actions → General → "Require approval for all external
     contributors").
2. **One job per pod, nothing is reused.** ARC registers each pod as an
   ephemeral just-in-time runner; the runner exits after one job and the pod
   is deleted. Kubernetes owns its generic ephemeral PVCs and deletes them
   with the pod; the scratch StorageClass's `Delete` reclaim policy removes
   their PV directories. Cleanup is asynchronous; no subsequent job mounts
   a previous job's directory. There is no shared cache volume.
3. **The pod cannot become the node.** The admission policy
   `tuna-ci-runner-pods` rejects any pod in `tuna-ci` that is not in its own
   user namespace (`hostUsers: false`), is privileged, shares host
   namespaces, binds host ports, mounts anything but emptyDir or fresh generic
   ephemeral `tuna-ci-scratch` volumes, mounts a service account token, or
   adds a capability other than `SYS_ADMIN`. Existing PVC references,
   hostPath, other storage classes, pre-bound volumes and data sources are
   forbidden. Root
   and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` in the pod (needed for `sudo apt-get` and rootless
   podman's nested user namespace) map to an unprivileged 65536-uid range on
   the node. No host paths are mounted; `/dev/net/tun` (podman's network)
   comes from KubeVirt's device plugin.
4. **No cluster access.** No service account token is mounted and the
   service accounts have no roles. NetworkPolicy `runners-internet-only`
   denies all ingress and allows egress only to cluster DNS and public
   addresses: the Kubernetes API (Service and `:6443` on every node
   address), the kubelet, other namespaces' pods and Services (corral-web,
   punjab, KubeVirt) and link-local metadata are unreachable.
5. **Headroom.** ResourceQuota `runner-ceiling` caps the namespace at 14 pods,
   56 CPU / 196 GiB limits, 28 CPU / 82 GiB requests: up to 14 runners
   run at once (karnataka: 28 CPU / 125 GiB allocatable; punjab is sized at
   12 cores / 24 GiB). Each runner asks for
   1.5 CPU / 5 GiB and is limited to 4 CPU / 14 GiB. The 45 GiB
   ephemeral-storage limit covers the container writable layer/logs, **not**
   the separate scratch PVCs (see below). Runner pods use PriorityClass
   `tuna-ci-runner` (-100, never preempts): new VMs and cluster services
   preempt them, and the kubelet evicts them first under
   memory pressure.
   All 14 new pods reserve 21 CPU / 70 GiB together; the request quota allows
   older pods during rollout. The scheduler also accounts for VM reservations.
   Aggregate memory limits exceed node capacity: they are not a guarantee that
   every runner can peak at once. Check memory pressure and disk latency before
   raising concurrency further.

The ARC listener uses the GitHub credential in secret `tuna-ci-github`
(`tuna-ci` namespace, copied by the controller to `arc-systems`). Runner
pods never mount it and cannot reach the API to read it.

### Dedicated runner scratch (nvme1n1)

`/home/runner/work` (including Cargo targets and rust-cache restore),
`/var/lib/containers`, and `/home/runner/.local/share/containers` are three
fresh generic ephemeral volumes per runner, requesting 40 / 10 / 10 GiB.
`/dev/shm` remains a 2 GiB memory emptyDir. All 14 runners request 840 GiB
on the 900 GiB ext4 LV `vg1/tuna_ci_scratch`, mounted at
`/var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch` on nvme1n1; nvme0n1 still holds the unchanged
kubelet/containerd roots and unrelated workloads.

The directory-backed local-path provisioner **does not enforce PVC size
limits**. The requests are capacity planning, not write quotas. Monitor
`df -h /var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch`; allow headroom for filesystem overhead and
asynchronous deletion, and reduce concurrency before the filesystem fills.
There is no persistent compiler cache and no extra access from runner pods.
Only the provisioner/helper pods in `tuna-ci-storage` can mount the host
scratch path. The k3s-managed `local-path` addon and existing PVCs are unchanged.

On this bootc/ostree host, install the persistent mount unit in writable
`/etc`, not a modified OS image. Initial setup (only for the confirmed empty
VG on nvme1n1; never format an existing LV):

```sh
ssh karnataka 'sudo pvs; sudo vgs; sudo lvs; sudo lsblk -f'
ssh karnataka 'sudo lvcreate -L 900G -n tuna_ci_scratch vg1 &&
  sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -L tuna-ci-scratch /dev/vg1/tuna_ci_scratch &&
  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch'
scp .github/runners/scratch.mount karnataka:/tmp/tuna-ci-scratch.mount
ssh karnataka 'unit=$(systemd-escape --path --suffix=mount /var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch) &&
  sudo install -m 0644 /tmp/tuna-ci-scratch.mount "/etc/systemd/system/$unit" &&
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload &&
  sudo systemctl enable --now "$unit" &&
  sudo restorecon /var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch &&
  sudo touch /var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch/.nvme-scratch'
ssh karnataka 'findmnt /var/lib/tuna-ci-scratch; sudo lvs -o lv_name,vg_name,devices'
.github/runners/deploy --sets-only
```

The mount is ordered before k3s on future boots; **do not restart k3s,
containerd, kubelet or unrelated pods** to deploy it. Helpers require the
`.nvme-scratch` marker on the mounted LV, so an absent mount fails
provisioning rather than silently falling back to nvme0n1. Never create
that marker on the underlying unmounted directory. Both deploy modes apply
guard rails and storage resources before updating runner templates; running
jobs keep their old volumes until completion.

To verify a rollout, inspect a newly created runner's PVC ownerReferences,
its PV's `local.path`, and `findmnt -T /home/runner/work` inside that pod.
Compare pod `metadata.creationTimestamp` with the runner container's
`state.running.startedAt` before/after, including provisioning time; observe
both disks' `/sys/block/nvme*n1/stat` counters over the same interval while
a real CI `check` job runs. Check that deleted pods' PVCs, PVs and directories
disappear, and that shared pods retain their UIDs/restart counts.

For storage rollback, first use the hosted-runner switch below and drain
the scale sets. Do not delete the provisioner while its PVCs/PVs still need
reclaim: wait for all `tuna-ci-scratch` claims and PVs to disappear, then
`kubectl --context karnataka-k3s delete -f .github/runners/storage.yaml`.
Only then disable/unmount the mount unit if needed. Leave the LV intact
until explicitly deciding to destroy its data. A Helm rollback to pre-scratch
values also restores the old per-pod writable-layer/emptyDir paths for new
jobs without restarting shared workloads, but restores nvme0n1 contention.

### Node prerequisite: NetworkPolicy enforcement

k3s enforces NetworkPolicy with its embedded kube-router, which reads rules
with `iptables-save`. Tailscale in nftables mode writes rules that
`iptables-save` cannot parse, which silently stops **all** NetworkPolicy
enforcement (`Aborting sync. Failed to run iptables-save` in the k3s log).
karnataka therefore runs tailscaled in iptables mode:

```
# /etc/systemd/system/tailscaled.service.d/10-firewall-iptables.conf
[Service]
Environment=TS_DEBUG_FIREWALL_MODE=iptables
```

`k3s.service` depends on `tailscaled.service`, so restarting tailscaled
restarts k3s (workloads keep running; the API is down for ~10 s). Check
enforcement after any tailscale or k3s upgrade:

```
ssh karnataka 'sudo iptables-save -t filter >/dev/null && echo ok'
ssh karnataka "sudo journalctl -u k3s --since -10min | grep -c 'Aborting sync'"   # expect 0
```

## Install from scratch

```
# 1. Guard rails (namespace, admission policy, NetworkPolicy, quota, priority).
#    Prepare the dedicated scratch LV/mount as above before deploying runners.
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s apply -f .github/runners/cluster.yaml

# 2. GitHub runner group restricted to this repository.
rid=$(gh api repos/tuna-os/tuna-desktop --jq .id)
gh api -X POST orgs/tuna-os/actions/runner-groups -f name=tuna-desktop-karnataka \
  -f visibility=selected -F "selected_repository_ids[]=$rid" -F allows_public_repositories=true

# 3. Credential, from files, never on the command line (see "Credentials").
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s -n tuna-ci create secret generic tuna-ci-github \
  --from-file=github_app_id=app_id --from-file=github_app_installation_id=installation_id \
  --from-file=github_app_private_key=app.pem

# 4. Images: builds both on karnataka, imports them into k3s' containerd and
#    points values-24.04.yaml / values-26.04.yaml at the new tags.
.github/runners/build-image

# 5. Guard rails again (idempotent), ARC controller, both scale sets.
.github/runners/deploy
```

Check: `kubectl -n tuna-ci get autoscalingrunnersets` shows both `Running`,
and `gh api orgs/tuna-os/actions/runner-groups/<id>/runners` lists the idle
`tuna-ci-24.04-runner-*`.

### Credentials

The listener needs a GitHub credential that may create runner registration
tokens for the org. Preferred: a GitHub App owned by `tuna-os` with only
**Organization → Self-hosted runners: Read and write**, installed on the org
(secret keys `github_app_id`, `github_app_installation_id`,
`github_app_private_key`). A classic PAT works too (key `github_token`, scope
`admin:org`), but carries far more power than ARC needs. Replace the secret
in place and restart the listeners:

```
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s -n tuna-ci create secret generic tuna-ci-github \
  --from-file=… --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl --context karnataka-k3s apply -f -
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s -n arc-systems delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/component=runner-scale-set-listener
```

Files holding credentials: create with `umask 077`, delete after use, strip
the trailing newline (`tr -d '\n'`), never echo them.

## Upgrade

**Runner image** (GitHub stops sending jobs to runners more than 30 days
behind the latest `actions/runner` release, so rebuild at least monthly, and
whenever a job needs a new preinstalled tool):

```
.github/runners/build-image             # new tags written into the values files
.github/runners/deploy --sets-only      # new pods use them; running jobs finish on the old
git commit .github/runners/values-*.yaml
# after running jobs finished, drop the old tags:
ssh karnataka 'sudo k3s ctr -n k8s.io images ls -q | grep tuna-ci-runner'
ssh karnataka 'sudo k3s ctr -n k8s.io images rm localhost/tuna-ci-runner:<old tag>'
```

`values-24.04.yaml` and `values-26.04.yaml` differ only in the scale set
name, image and min/max runners; change both together.

### Preinstalled CI dependencies and image smoke checks

The image preinstalls the common `ci.yml` compositor/shell development
packages (seat/input/udev, DRM/GBM/EGL, Wayland, GTK4/libadwaita, GLib,
PipeWire, font/rendering and PAM headers/wrapper) and the nested proof
runtime (X11/XWayland, media, AT-SPI/Python, IBus, keyring and desktop
portals). This moves repeated apt download/unpack work out of individual
jobs, reducing contention on the node's disk; it does not add runner slots
or a shared writable compiler cache. Each job still gets its own ephemeral
pod and keeps its workflow apt steps for hosted-runner compatibility and
package updates.

Package versions come from the image's own Ubuntu release repositories.
Only 26.04 preinstalls distro `libgtk4-layer-shell-dev`, Orca and
speech-dispatcher for journey/orca-speech. 24.04 keeps the existing pinned
`scripts/ci-install-gtk4-layer-shell` build in its jobs: that release has no
distro package. Do not replace 26.04's distro library with a `/usr/local`
build; its installed-package proofs require distro provenance.

Build only when the node has disk-I/O headroom, not while tuning or running
a heavily loaded queue. `build-image` already builds the releases
sequentially, imports their images, and updates the two local values files;
it does **not** deploy them. No rebuild or rollout is implied by changing
the Containerfile. After review, build and smoke both imported tags before
the separate rollout:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
.github/runners/build-image karnataka
# Offline library/package checks only: these do not register a runner.
for ubuntu in 24.04 26.04; do
  while read -r key ref; do
    [[ "$key" == image: ]] || continue
    ssh karnataka "sudo k3s ctr -n k8s.io run --rm '$ref' \
      'tuna-runner-smoke-${ubuntu//./-}' /bin/sh -ec '
        pkg-config --exists libseat libinput libudev gbm libdrm xkbcommon \
          wayland-client gtk4 libadwaita-1 libpipewire-0.3
        dpkg-query -W libpam0g-dev libpam-wrapper libgtk-4-dev \
          libadwaita-1-dev libglib2.0-dev meson xwayland
        test -x /opt/tuna-ci/job-started.sh
        if [ \"$ubuntu\" = 26.04 ]; then
          pkg-config --atleast-version=1.1 gtk4-layer-shell-0
          dpkg-query -W libgtk4-layer-shell-dev orca speech-dispatcher
        else
          ! pkg-config --exists gtk4-layer-shell-0
        fi
      '"
  done < ".github/runners/values-${ubuntu}.yaml"
done
# Deploy only after both smoke checks and review of the new image tags.
.github/runners/deploy --sets-only
```

These checks are not full job qualification. After rollout, require passing
`check`/`gtk-shell` (24.04) and `journey`/`orca-speech` (26.04) on the exact
reviewed commit, including their existing package/proof assertions. Until
the images have been built and these lanes pass, runtime compatibility and
the reduction in apt time remain unverified.

Images are node-local and `imagePullPolicy: Never`; if kubelet image garbage
collection ever removes one (disk above 85%), pods fail with
`ErrImageNeverPull`: rebuild.

**ARC chart**: controller and scale sets must run the same chart version.
Bump `ARC_CHART_VERSION`'s default in `deploy` (and the version in this
page), then run `.github/runners/deploy`: it upgrades the controller first.

## Scale

`minRunners` (idle, pre-registered pods) and `maxRunners` live in the values
files: 24.04 is 1–10, 26.04 is 0–4. Keep `maxRunners` of both sets within the
quota's 14 pods; the scheduler can still withhold slots for VM reservations.
Change the quota in `cluster.yaml` only after checking punjab and KubeVirt
(`kubectl describe node karnataka`). Apply guard rails with
`kubectl --context karnataka-k3s apply -f .github/runners/cluster.yaml`, then
runner values with `.github/runners/deploy --sets-only`. A temporary change
without editing files applies the same `--set` to both sets:

```
.github/runners/deploy --sets-only -- --set maxRunners=2
```

## Drain (maintenance on karnataka)

1. Send new jobs to GitHub: `gh variable set CI_RUNNERS -b hosted -R tuna-os/tuna-desktop`.
2. Stop creating runners:
   `.github/runners/deploy --sets-only -- --set minRunners=0 --set maxRunners=0`.
   Running jobs finish; idle runners are removed.
3. Wait for `kubectl --context karnataka-k3s -n tuna-ci get pods` to be
   empty (or cancel the remaining runs).
4. Undo in reverse order: `.github/runners/deploy --sets-only`, then
   `gh variable delete CI_RUNNERS -R tuna-os/tuna-desktop`.

Jobs already queued for a `tuna-ci-*` label when you flip the variable keep
waiting for that label: re-run them (`gh run rerun <id> --failed` after
cancelling) so they pick the hosted label.

## Roll back to GitHub-hosted runners

One switch:

```
gh variable set CI_RUNNERS -b hosted -R tuna-os/tuna-desktop
```

Every job evaluated afterwards uses its original GitHub-hosted label
(`ubuntu-latest` / `ubuntu-26.04`); assertions are identical on both.
Re-run queued runs as in [Drain](#drain-maintenance-on-karnataka).
`gh variable delete CI_RUNNERS -R tuna-os/tuna-desktop` switches back.

Full removal:

```
helm --kube-context karnataka-k3s uninstall tuna-ci-24-04 tuna-ci-26-04 -n tuna-ci
helm --kube-context karnataka-k3s uninstall arc -n arc-systems
# After all scratch claims/PVs have reclaimed (keep the provisioner until then):
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s delete -f .github/runners/storage.yaml
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s delete -f .github/runners/cluster.yaml
kubectl --context karnataka-k3s delete namespace arc-systems
gh api -X DELETE orgs/tuna-os/actions/runner-groups/<id>
ssh karnataka 'sudo k3s ctr -n k8s.io images ls -q | grep tuna-ci-runner | xargs -r sudo k3s ctr -n k8s.io images rm'
```

and replace the `*runner-24` / `*runner-26` aliases and anchors in `ci.yml`
with `ubuntu-latest` / `ubuntu-26.04`.

## Caches

`actions/cache` (and `Swatinem/rust-cache` on top of it) works unchanged on
the self-hosted runners: it talks to GitHub's cache service over HTTPS, and
the cache keys (`ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-26.04` from `/etc/os-release`) match
the hosted runners', so both share entries. As before, only trusted `main`
runs save Rust caches; pull requests restore.

A shared sccache volume or bucket was considered and not deployed. Jobs run
as root in their pod, so any job that could write a shared compiler cache
could plant objects that later `main` builds (and published images) link,
and a shared volume would break "nothing persists between jobs". sccache has
no per-entry integrity check that would make a shared writable cache safe
across branches.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Look at |
| --- | --- |
| Jobs stay queued on a `tuna-ci-*` label | `kubectl -n arc-systems logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=runner-scale-set-listener`; `kubectl -n tuna-ci get ephemeralrunners`; `kubectl -n tuna-ci describe resourcequota` |
| Pod rejected | `kubectl -n tuna-ci get events` (admission policy message names the rule) |
| `refused this job` in "Set up job" | the job-started hook: fork, foreign repository or disallowed event |
| A step misses a tool GitHub's image has | add it to the Containerfile's package list, rebuild, roll |
| Nested podman/docker errors | needs `/dev/net/tun` (tun resource), the ephemeral scratch storage mounts and `SYS_ADMIN`, all in the values files |
| Controller cannot get a registration token | credential expired or lacks org runner permission; replace the secret |
| Scratch PVC stays Pending | `kubectl -n tuna-ci-storage logs deployment/tuna-ci-scratch-provisioner`; check the mount/marker on karnataka and scratch free space; do not fall back to the OS disk |
